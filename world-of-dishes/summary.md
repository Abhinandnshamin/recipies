I had a very bad opinion of the taste of mushroom at the beginning...
even eating outside...mushrooms were like okay! 
but this, once i start, i can't stop.It leaves me mouthwatering. i can guess that some ingredients may not be there(ginger-garlic paste) but you should be trying the recipe.

**I STRONGLY GIVE THE RECOMMENDATION TO TRY**
**"MUSHROOM CURRY" BECAME ONE OF MY FAVOURITE DISHES FROM THE HATED**
**I AM NOT SURE HOW IT WILL TASTE WITHOUT ANY OF THESE INGREDIENTS**
